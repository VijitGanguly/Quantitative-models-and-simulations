This project simulates stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) via Monte Carlo methods and compares them with the analytical solution of GBM. It is useful for understanding stochastic processes in financial modeling, particularly for pricing derivatives and forecasting stock prices.
The project consists of two main components:

GBM Simulator (GBM_simulator.py)
Simulates multiple stock price paths using the Monte Carlo method based on the GBM model.

GBM Pricer (GBM_pricer.py)
Computes the analytical solution of the GBM formula for a given time and Brownian motion value.

Main Notebook (main.ipynb)
Integrates both the simulator and pricer to compare simulated results with the analytical solution.
