In this folder I simulated Hull-White model using Additive OU process and Extendend Hull-White model (Drift based).
Additive OU process: The additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck formulation of the Hull–White model expresses the short rate as a combination of several independent mean-reverting components. Each component evolves according to its own Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, collectively shaping the dynamics of the interest rate. In essence, this three-factor Hull–White model can be viewed as the sum of three correlated one-factor Hull–White processes.
Extendend Hull-White model (Drift based): The extended Hull–White model enhances the basic framework by introducing auxiliary mean-reverting factors that influence the drift of the short rate. Rather than being directly additive, these factors shape the rate's evolution through a deterministic function, allowing for greater flexibility in modeling yield curves and enforcing rate positivity. This makes the model well-suited for complex instruments and calibration tasks, though at the cost of increased computational complexity
